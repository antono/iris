      At the core of Iris is a re-usable message passing system.  #IrisMessage is the core data type
      used for passing information.  #IrisMessage instances are passed through an #IrisPort.
      #IrisPort is a light-weight mailbox for sending messages.  They can either queue the messages
      locally or deliver the messages to a recipient.  Think of them as your local post-office.
